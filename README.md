## My process

- I started with simple steps doing the HTML, while using Emmet.Then the css, letting the chart for last, because i knew i would have to use an framework, after testing some charts, most of them took me some time and it was impossible to translate the design, after a time i have decided to use Apexcharts, i have tried to use Styled-Components, but in the end most of styles were done configurating the Apexcharts in Js

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [ApexCharts](https://apexcharts.com/docs/creating-first-javascript-chart/) - JS library

### What I learned

- I learned how to configure better my project, i've started with
simple html and css, after that i tried to create an an component react for the chart, after some testing i realized vanilla would be simplier, both for react and vanilla i used npm Vite. 

### Continued development

In the future, i wolud like to connect this to another services, and improve the project
